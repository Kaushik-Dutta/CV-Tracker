#CV-Tracker

This a REST based application in which I have taken data from a git repository which tracks the total number of cases due to corona virus globally.

github repository for the data : https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The data when rendered into the application it came out to be in CSV format.

This was a good task to take the information frame it and use it. We have use Thymeleaf as a template engine to serve our purpose which acted as aview component for our project. 

Check out the code: JDK 11 is essential for this project to run.
